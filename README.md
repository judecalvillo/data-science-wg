## Thanks for stopping by!

The **Data Science Working Group’s** purpose is to efficiently assess and tackle Code for San Francisco’s data science needs. Our practicing and aspiring data scientists are available to:  

+ assess/inspire the possibility of data science components in other projects;
+ provide resources to help produce those components;
+ provide a learning environment for ourselves and others to learn more practical data science.

In pursuing the above, we humbly hope that CfSF's dedicated project groups come to consider us an integral and synergistic resource for the group at large.

### Administration

Team Leads: [Jude Calvillo](http://linkd.in/1BGeytb) and [Sanat Moningi](http://bit.ly/1PFurlp)  
Lead Data Scientist: [Matthew Pancia](http://bit.ly/1PFuA8k)  
Wiki (resources): [DSWG Wiki >>](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg/wiki)  

### Current Initiatives

The DSWG's initiatives are centered on building data science components for CfSF's project groups. We do, however, also pursue exploratory analyses that could inspire dedicated projects at CfSF, as well as develop standalone visualization tools.
